- 👋 Hi, I’m @wbmartin3
- 👀 I’m interested in programming a buy/sell heat map using at least three weighted independent variables.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning very little. I have virtually no experience with Python though I learned Fortran, Cobol, Basic, dBase IV, and MS Access.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how I can get up to speed on doing this.  Where can I get the stock market data for free, if possible. I've used Factset, IBES, and incorporated manual inputs in the past.
- 📫 How to reach me best via email at wbmartin3@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I hitchhiked from So Cal to No Cal to visit the colleges I was considering after high school. It was an experience that included a visit to the Moonie's "home" in San Francisco.
